# 2024-4e-bogdanov-Prague_analyser

## About project
This is school project for the year 2024/2025.  

This project divide city of Prague into regions based on public services. Each area contains a point. Any other point within this region is closest to that given point (service).
That is called a Voronoi diagram. To create Voronoi diagram I use Fortune's algorithm. For now the public services are: Pharmacy, Subway station, Bus stop.
